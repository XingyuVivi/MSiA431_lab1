**Prompt**: Create a new folder in Hadoop (not in the local filesystem)

**Response**: 

To create a new folder in Hadoop, you can use the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) command-line interface. Here are the steps to follow:
Open a terminal and connect to the Hadoop cluster using SSH.

Use the following command to create a new folder in HDFS:
"hdfs dfs -mkdir /path/to/new/folder"

For example, if you want to create a folder named "data" in the root directory, you can use the following command:
"hdfs dfs -mkdir /data"
