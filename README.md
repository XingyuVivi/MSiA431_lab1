**Task3**

**Prompt**: Create a new folder in Hadoop (not in the local filesystem)

**Response**: 

To create a new folder in Hadoop, you can use the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) command-line interface. Here are the steps to follow:
Open a terminal and connect to the Hadoop cluster using SSH.

Use the following command to create a new folder in HDFS:
"hdfs dfs -mkdir /path/to/new/folder"

For example, if you want to create a folder named "data" in the root directory, you can use the following command:
"hdfs dfs -mkdir /data"


**Task4**

**Prompt**: Move one file that you have just uploaded to Wolf to the new folder in Hadoop

**Response**: 

Assuming that you have already uploaded the file to the Wolf cluster and that you know the path of the file, you can use the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) command-line interface to move the file to the new folder you just created. Here are the steps to follow:

Use the following command to move the file to the new folder in Hadoop:
"hdfs dfs -mv /path/to/uploaded/file /path/to/new/folder/"

Replace "/path/to/uploaded/file" with the actual path of the file you uploaded to Wolf, and "/path/to/new/folder/" with the actual path of the new folder you created in Hadoop.

For example, if you uploaded a file named "example.txt" to the "/home/user" directory on Wolf, and you created a new folder named "data" in Hadoop's root directory, you can use the following command to move the file to the new folder:
"hdfs dfs -mv /home/user/example.txt /data/" 

**Task5**

**Prompt**: Rename this file in Hadoop

**Response**: 

To rename a file in Hadoop using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) command-line interface, you can use the mv command. Here are the steps to follow:

Use the following command to rename the file in Hadoop:
"hdfs dfs -mv /path/to/old/file /path/to/new/file"

Replace "/path/to/old/file" with the actual path of the file you want to rename, and "/path/to/new/file" with the new name and location of the file.

For example, if you want to rename a file named "example.txt" located in the "/data" directory to "newfile.txt" and move it to the "/data/newfolder" directory, you can use the following command:
"hdfs dfs -mv /data/example.txt /data/newfolder/newfile.txt"

**Task6**

**Prompt**: Copy this file from Hadoop to the local filesystem

**Response**: 

To copy a file from Hadoop to the local filesystem using the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) command-line interface, you can use the get command. Here are the steps to follow:

Use the following command to copy the file from Hadoop to the local filesystem:
"hdfs dfs -get /path/to/file /path/to/destination"

Replace "/path/to/file" with the actual path of the file you want to copy from Hadoop, and "/path/to/destination" with the destination path in the local filesystem where you want to copy the file.

For example, if you want to copy a file named "example.txt" located in the "/data" directory in Hadoop to the "/home/user" directory in the local filesystem, you can use the following command:
"hdfs dfs -get /data/example.txt /home/user/example.txt"


**Task7**

**Prompt**: Create a second folder in Hadoop. Copy two small text files to it. Then extract from Hadoop a single file that is going to be the concatenation of the two files, i.e., appending one file to the other one. (use getmerge

**Response**: 

Sure, here are the steps to create a second folder in Hadoop, copy two small text files to it, and then extract from Hadoop a single file that is going to be the concatenation of the two files:

Create a new folder in Hadoop using the following command:
"hdfs dfs -mkdir /secondfolder"

Copy two small text files to the new folder using the following commands:
"hdfs dfs -put file1.txt /secondfolder/
hdfs dfs -put file2.txt /secondfolder/"
Replace "file1.txt" and "file2.txt" with the actual names of the text files that you want to copy to the new folder.

Concatenate the two files into a single file using the getmerge command as follows:
"hdfs dfs -getmerge /secondfolder/file1.txt /secondfolder/file2.txt output.txt"

This command will merge the contents of the files file1.txt and file2.txt located in the /secondfolder directory of Hadoop and create a new file named output.txt in the current directory of the local file system.

Verify that the output file has been created and contains the concatenated data by checking its contents using any text editor.
That's it! You have successfully created a second folder in Hadoop, copied two small text files to it, and merged them into a single file using the getmerge command.


**Task8**

**Prompt**: Take a different file on your local filesystem, move it to Hadoop, and then within Hadoop copy the same file to Tuckerâ€™s folder (/user/tlewis)

**Response**: 

Sure, here are the steps to move a file from the local filesystem to Hadoop, and then copy the same file to Tucker's folder:

Move the file from the local filesystem to Hadoop using the following command:
"hdfs dfs -put /path/to/local/file /hadoop/folder"

Replace "/path/to/local/file" with the actual path of the file that you want to move to Hadoop, and "/hadoop/folder" with the Hadoop folder where you want to store the file.

For example, if you want to move a file named "example.txt" located in the "/home/user" directory in the local filesystem to the "/data" directory in Hadoop, you can use the following command:
"hdfs dfs -put /home/user/example.txt /data/"

Copy the same file to Tucker's folder using the following command:
"hdfs dfs -cp /hadoop/folder/example.txt /user/tlewis/"

Replace "/hadoop/folder/example.txt" with the actual path of the file that you want to copy, and "/user/tlewis/" with Tucker's folder in Hadoop where you want to store the file.

For example, if you want to copy the "example.txt" file located in the "/data" directory in Hadoop to Tucker's folder "/user/tlewis/", you can use the following command:
"hdfs dfs -cp /data/example.txt /user/tlewis/"
